The DYING SUN streams through high windows, painting
Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.
Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm. Ever hear of it?
Harry shakes his head.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force. For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield. The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.
Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory. And not
just any. This memory needs to be
a very happy one. And powerful.
Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something? Good. Let it fill
you up.
Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum. Without your
wand...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum...
(CONTINUED)
86 INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK 86
68.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Shall we?
Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin, watching closely,
reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Concentrate, Harry.
Concentrate...
As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand
trembles. His eyes begin to roll up...
HARRY
Expecto... Expecto...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quickly.
Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
recover.
HARRY
That's one nasty Dementor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Boggart, Harry. The real thing
would be much, much worse. Just
out of interest, what were you
thinking of? What memory did you
choose?
